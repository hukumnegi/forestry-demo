The Kidney Transplant surgery is a procedure involves removing unhealthy kidney and replaced with healthy Kidney from donor. Usually, in this case the patients receive only one kidney which is a new one and in some rare cases they may receive two kidneys. On the front side of the patient the liver transplant is done at the position of the lower side of the abdomen.

Earlier considered to be an impossible treatment method, the renal transplant has been made possible by the advent of the modern technology and techniques. In fact, the efficiency, safety and noninvasive method of Kidney Transplant Surgery have made it popular among the people. As the whole kidney is replaced in this treatment, there is no need of frequent dialysis as well as another form of frequent renal care.
